I match top tech talent with exciting career opportunities.

As a professional with years of experience in full-cycle recruitment, sourcing, stakeholder management, and employer branding, I have a strong track record of helping companies build diverse and talented teams 🧑🏻‍💻.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new places 🌍, staying active through workouts 🏋️, and relaxing with a good cup of coffee ☕️ and some video games 🎮. I’m a social person who values connecting with others and sharing ideas 🤝.

Don’t hesitate to reach out and say hello 👋!
